# What is mvcct-odata?
mvcct-odata is a alightweight JavaScript [OData](http://www.odata.org/) client. It supports just queries, with filter or free search,
sorting, and gtouping+aggregation.

Queries are represented as nested objects with JavasCript methods to get their corresponding OData string representation.
This way queries are easily built and modified by adding, removing substituting and editing plain JavaScript objects.

OData objects with all they methods can be easily extracted from their Json representations, 
so queries can be easily exchanged with the server and stored in all browser storage types
(cookies, local storage, etc.).
